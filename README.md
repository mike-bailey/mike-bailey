Welcome to my Github!


I'm a Philadelphia transplant from DC enjoying the city to the best of my ability. I like cybersecurity and automation and work in DFIR at the moment but largely floated around the company.

I don't get to open source much at work so please accept a picture of my dog as an apology:
